        We aim to inspire a love for Jesus and His return in the hearts of many through divers campaigns. We hold outdoor rallies, indoor conferences, trainings, workshops, webinars, distribute flyers, posters, stickers, share contents online, put up billboards, etc. to prepare the world for the return of Jesus-The King, one city at a time.
        <br>
        <br>
        The Jesus Lovers Club is our coaching platform to raise kings, marketplace authorities, whp will lend their voices of influence to our campaigns.
        <br>
        <br>
        We have a dream, that one day very soon, we will see <strong>A Million Man Marches</strong> organised by Jesus Lovers in the different cities of this world, in joyous celebration and anticipation of The King's Return.
        <br>
        <br>
        Even So, Come Lord Jesus!
